Clarty. There's no better word to describe the conditions at Saturday's Saucony National Cross Country Championships. It was right clarty. Back to back winter storms had seen fit to empty the heavens, leaving the course a mess of mud and sludge. *Or*, as I like to think of it, perfect cross country conditions. 

This year's championships were at Wollaton Hall in Nottingham, used as Wayne Manor in *The Dark Knight Rises*. An Elizabethan Country House surrounded by 500 acres of park land, it makes a fantastic venue for racing. 

A good friend from the club had told me that I had to experience the nationals, and he was bang on. The atmosphere is great with thousands of runners coming from across the country. Tents spring up in club colours, with flags fluttering outside to show their crests.

There's ten races across the day, ranging from under thirteens to seniors. We arrived in plenty of time to watch some of the junior races. This was good, in that it gave an idea of what was to come; this was also bad, in that it gave an idea of what was to come.

While in the Harrier league we start in waves, this is an all out race and the start is as exhilarating as it is bonkers. Almost two thousand athletes stood five deep along a huge start line, ready to take off as soon as the gun goes.

I went off as quick as I could manage, eager to get around the first corner and avoid any bottlenecking. I spent the rest of the first few minutes wondering if my increased training had made me much faster or if I would slow down. You already know the answer to that, and sure enough I settled in to a more manageable pace.

It was a tape your shoes kind of day, anything to help keep them on your feet as you launched yourself calf deep through clag and clart. There were several sections where the only option was to run through puddles that had grown into ten food wide pools.

I'm finding in multi-terrain events I tend to fair better on the challenging parts. I lose ground on the flat and relatively dry, probably due to my lack of speed work, but make it up through the mud or up hill.

By the time I passed the start line to begin the final lap, I could hear the commentator proclaiming the lightning like finish of Gateshead's Calum Johnson. He'd somehow managed to average 3:20/km around the whole course. Incredible stuff. I can't compute how you move your legs that fast in that much mud.

By the last lap I'd found my favoured route through the worst of the flooded sections and the muddiest bits. I took the outside line to avoid the crowds pushing through the middle, it may be a bit longer but having a clear run through made it quicker.

Next came the push up the hill to the back door of the Hall, and I noticed I was racing a guy with one shoe and one bare foot. He wasn't alone on a day where the mud seemed to have an unquenchable appetite for shoes. Hats off to all the runners who kept giving 100% even without their footwear.

The last lap is also the longest and takes you on an extra little loop through the woods before following the line of the lake. As I passed the 12km mark it was clear there was still some way to go, which made it hard to know when to give a final push. As the finish came into view there was one last quagmire to run through before the relief of the line.

I'd pushed hard the whole way and felt good about my pace. Feeling in good form combined with mud, pools and logs to jump made this one of the most enjoyable races I've entered. Already looking forward to next year.
