April 2020. The month started with *[Kilian Jornet announcing his retirement from trail running to focus on fishing](https://www.salomon.com/en-gb/blog/jornet-announces-retirement-trail-running)*. I'd be more than happy to step up and take his place, but to quote the Easter story, 'the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak'. Luckily for the running world it was an April fool, during a week otherwise devoid of much to laugh at.

The whole of April has been lockdown, which has been a very different experience for everyone. Something I'm learning this month is not to apologise or feel guilt for finding good things at the moment. It's easy when there's so much pain in the world to feel bad over things that bring us joy.

Lockdown has been good for me in many ways. The rhythm of life feels much more sustainable. I work, I exercise, I rest. Saturdays are spacious and full of down time. I'm not spending my time rushing to be anywhere, but rather just learning to be.

As an introvert not feeling the constant pressure to be in extrovert environments has been great for my mental health. I've found that a lot of the stress I'd thought was part of me is actually a result of the society we live in. We idolise busy, obsess over productivity, and behave as though relationships are best measured in number rather than quality. 

There's something beautiful about taking our time more. If we could combine that with having the ability to see each other without the threat of transmitting a deadly disease, we could be on a winner. I'd love to think that society might somewhere in all this learn to live life at a more sustainable pace. 

Anyway, alongside that, this has been a great month for running. I finished April having ran 303km, my highest monthly total yet. I ran my best marathon effort yet, socially distancing as part of the #OperationInspiration challenge. And then over the past couple of weeks I've ran personal bests for both the 5 and 10k distances.

We've been lucky in the UK in that our lockdown has allowed us to still exercise. I know that a lot of countries haven't had that privilege. 

I decided early on that as long as I could, I would try to continue training throughout. I've adapted a little as races have been cancelled, but kept overall distance high.

My current plan is to keep doing 70-80km a week, but to settle into a place where my usual long run is 24km rather than 32km. I'll sometimes go longer to keep my fitness up, but won't build the distances consistently again until we know when racing might return.

The shorter long run should mean I recover quicker over Sunday, which is either a rest day or a very easy jog day. During the week I'm mixing in some running at max effort, usually as part of a virtual time trial race with the Heaton Harriers.

Alongside this I've decided to start adding specific hill training. I'm very conscious that being unable to get out to the hills has a negative effect. At the moment I plan to do a hill session every couple of weeks with a good number of reps on a steep hill near me. I'm making it feel more engaging by setting the amount of vert for the session based on the elevation of some of my favourite hills, an idea I pinched from someone at the club.

I'm hoping that this combination of training can help me to keep pushing myself at the moment, and keep building endurance and speed.
